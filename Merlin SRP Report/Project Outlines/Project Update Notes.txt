- Literature review
 > Payload signature
	+ Doomed in the face of encryption
 > Reverse engineering: ONly viable if you've got a 'live copy' sitting around.
 > TDG paper
 > DNS paper
 > Anti-TDG paper

- Thoughts
 > Bots need to talk out somehow.
	+ Use IP or DNS. Only two options.
 > If they use IP, not much we can do but that is probably not common
 > If they use DNS, they are going to produce some unique patterns.
	+ E.g. Conficker
 > Look at DNS.

- Approach
 > Literature review (An ongoing process)
 > Get data sample
 > Look at data sample (!)
	+ There is a distinct lack of software that allows us to look at very large volumes of data, and interactively trim/process the visuals, so writing one.
 > Prototype some algorithm
 > Magic...
 > Profit!
