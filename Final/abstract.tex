In a world that runs on data, protection of that data and protection of the \emph{motion} of that data is of the utmost importantance. Covert communication channels attempt to circumvent established methods of control, such as firewalls and proxies, by utilizing non-standard means of getting messages between two endpoints. DNS (Domain Name System), the system that translates text-based resource names into IP addresses, is a very common and effective platform upon which covert channels are built. This work proposes, and demonstrates the effectiveness of, a novel new technique that estimates data transmission throughput over DNS and its weight against the norm for a given network link to identify the existence of a DNS tunnel. The proposed technique is robust in the face of the obfuscation techniques that are able to hide tunnels from existing detection methods.
